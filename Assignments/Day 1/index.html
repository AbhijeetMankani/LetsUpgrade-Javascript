        <h1>Question 2</h1>
        <p id="Q2">
            var and let are used for mutable variable declaration, while, const declares an immutable variable or a constant<br>
            assigning a value to a constant(const-declared variable) will cause an error to occur<br>

            var was there in JS since ES5 while let and const arrived in ES6<br>
            <br>
            scope of var:<br>
                var can be global or function scoped<br>
                <br>
            The problem with var:<br>
                var-variables can be re-declared, and thius we cannot have the same variable name inside and outside of a function for 2 different variable, they will be considered as the same variable.
                (Code1:)<br>
                <br>
            let:<br>
                let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered.<br>
                <br>
            scope of let:<br>
                let is block scoped. I.E. it can only be used inside the block in which it was declared(block is anything inside curly braces{} ) (Code2:)<br>
                <br>
            let can be updated but not re-declared.<br>
                Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. <br>
                <br>
                However, if the same variable is defined in different scopes, there will be no error.<br>
                <br>

        <h1>Question 3</h1>
        <p>
            Javascript hosts 3 main data types:<br>
                1. Numbers<br>
                2. Strings<br>
                3. Objects<br>
                4. Functions<br>
                5. Boolean<br>  
                <br>
                All the variables though, are declared using the var, let or const keyword<br>
                <br>

                Apart from this there is another data type too, undefined<br>
                This is the value when a variable is declared without assigning the value<br>
                <br>
                typeof is a keyword that returns the type of the value provided<br>
